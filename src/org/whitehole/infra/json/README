This library provides classes for representing JSON objects, and for 
reading and writing them.

It was initially a simple implementation of JSR-353, but it proved to be 
too much restrictive (e.g. JsonValues are immutable), and its design and 
naming were questionable (e.g. multiplication of interfaces and abstract 
methods, saying "JsonGenerator" for an instantiation of the "builder"
design pattern).
