This library provides classes for representing JSON objects, and for 
reading and writing them.

It was initially an implementation of JSR-353, but the following flaws
were identified:
- JsonValues are immutable;
- naming is questionable (e.g. "JsonGenerator", for an instantiation
  of the "builder" design pattern);
- it is over-designed: there are too many interfaces and abstract 
  methods
